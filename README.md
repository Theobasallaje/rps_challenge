# Welcome to my Rock Paper Scissors Game!

# NOTE: Chat only works if you start the game, that way you know who you are talking to. 

# Instructions:
# Enter your name in the first field and click start (enter will NOT work) to be player one or player two.
# Player assignments are based on the order the players enter the game, player one will be the first player to click start.
# Once player two joins the game, player one will be prompted to select Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
# After player one selects an option, player two will be able to see that player one picked and then be prompted for their choice.
# After player two picked, both player's options will be displayed along with the score.
# The game will be finished at this point and you will have the option to reset or rematch.

# Rematch resets only the players. You will need to enter the name of the players in the order previously entered for the score to be accurate.
# Reset resets the score, the players, and the chat. You can enter players in any order after this option is selected.

# Play Now!
